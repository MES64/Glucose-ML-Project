# Glucose ML Project

My MSc in Machine Learning final project: Learning models for glucose prediction in diabetes therapy

The dissertation can also be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UYdnytu9_ZPl8ojw4OhyeasOVCfd3C-0/view?usp=sharing

The most important file to look at is init.py, then train_???.py, and then test_???.py in that order. Also, look at overall_plots.py and different_time_series_lengths.py. See Section 8 - How to use my project
